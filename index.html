            <h2 class="hi"> Hi!</h2>
            <p class="intro">I started learning the basics of software in February 2023, and a few months later I started learning game software. I have a game that I made and published as a game jam. I am currently taking the web development course given by Angela Yu. For about me extra information, I also like reading books and watching movies.</p>

                <h3>Camping</h3>
                <p>I love camping and spending time with my friends here. I enjoy cooking different meals while camping and chatting around the campfire. The only thing I don't like about the camp is that people want to take unnecessary risks even though the danger level has increased.</p>

            <div class="travel">
                <h3>Travel</h3>
                <p>I like to visit historical places, caves, any place that is different. The thing I don't like most if there is someone with me while I am traveling is that they disrespectfully want to end the tour quickly while I am examining or reading something.</p>

                <h3>Watching The Sea</h3>
                <p>I grew up in a seaside city. What I noticed while growing up here is that watching the sea gives you a special serenity. For me, it's like it's taking my problems away with its waves for a moment.</p>
